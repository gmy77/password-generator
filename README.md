# Password Generator

## What is this Project?

This is a simple web application that utilizes jQuery to generate random passwords. The user can choose to generate passwords 1 to 64 characters long and include a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. No symbols that require alt codes are used. The site is published on my GitHub Pages at https://zmuranaka.github.io/password-generator/.

## Directories:
