# Quantum Random Password Generator

## What is this Project?

This is a simple web application that utilizes jQuery and ANU's quantum random number generator to generate true random passwords. Most random number generators rely on pseudorandom algorithms which only approximate true randomness. By querying ANU's quantum random number generator API, true randomness can be achieved. The user can choose to generate passwords 1 to 128 characters long and include a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. No symbols that require alt codes are used. The site is published on my GitHub Pages at https://zmuranaka.github.io/password-generator/.
